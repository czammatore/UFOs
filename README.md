# UFOs

## Project Scope 

The goal of this project was to provide an easy to use, interactive webpage that makes the data that has been gathered about UFOs easy to filter, sort and read through. By using both JavaScript and HTML, we have accomplished that goal. 

## User guide to the site
Visitors to the site are able to search for UFO sightings by city, state, country, date, and shape. All they have to do is simply fill in as many or as few of the critera as they wish to enter.

## Pain points and further use
One drawback of the way the webpage is currently set up is that all the fields for search are based on a user entry of text - so anything from a spelling error in a city name to a lack of vocabuluary regarding the shape or type of object they're looking for will not provide the desired results. To get around this, I would recommend that the webpage be further enhanced by using lists and interactive filters similar to those you might see on an e-commerce website such as Amazon. For example, if one selected the state of "Arizona", then all possible counties, cities and shapes might appear so that you can further filter based upon those. Further information could also be gathered so that we can filter by time of day for the sighting, whether or not there were any other witnesses to the sighting, and if what was observed was visual, auditory, or both.
